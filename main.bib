	title = {Differential Forms in Algebraic Topology},
	abstract = {The guiding principle in this book is to use differential forms as an aid in exploring some of the less digestible aspects of algebraic topology. Accord­ ingly, we move primarily in the realm of smooth manifolds and use the de Rham theory as a prototype of all of cohomology. For applications to homotopy theory we also discuss by way of analogy cohomology with arbitrary coefficients. Although we have in mind an audience with prior exposure to algebraic or differential topology, for the most part a good knowledge of linear algebra, advanced calculus, and point-set topology should suffice. Some acquaintance with manifolds, simplicial complexes, singular homology and cohomology, and homotopy groups is helpful, but not really necessary. Within the text itself we have stated with care the more advanced results that are needed, so that a mathematically mature reader who accepts these background materials on faith should be able to read the entire book with the minimal prerequisites. There are more materials here than can be reasonably covered in a one-semester course. Certain sections may be omitted at first reading with­ out loss of continuity. We have indicated these in the schematic diagram that follows. This book is not intended to be foundational},

	title = {Singularities, bifurcations and catastrophes / James Montaldi},
	isbn = {9781316585085 ebook},
	abstract = {Suitable for advanced undergraduates, postgraduates and researchers, this self-contained textbook provides an introduction to the mathematics lying at the foundations of bifurcation theory. The theory is built up gradually, beginning with the well-developed approach to singularity theory through right-equivalence. The text proceeds with contact equivalence of map-germs and finally presents the path formulation of bifurcation theory. This formulation, developed partly by the author, is more general and more flexible than the original one dating from the 1980s. A series of appendices discuss standard background material, such as calculus of several variables, existence and uniqueness theorems for {ODEs}, and some basic material on rings and modules. Based on the author's own teaching experience, the book contains numerous examples and illustrations. The wealth of end-of-chapter problems develop and reinforce understanding of the key ideas and techniques: solutions to a selection are provided.},

A key concept in mathematics, smooth manifolds are ubiquitous: They appear as Riemannian manifolds in differential geometry; as space-times in general relativity; as phase spaces and energy levels in mechanics; as domains of definition of {ODEs} in dynamical systems; as Lie groups in algebra and geometry; and in many other areas. The book first presents the language of smooth manifolds, culminating with the Frobenius theorem, before discussing the language of tensors (which includes a presentation of the exterior derivative of differential forms). It then covers Lie groups and Lie algebras, briefly addressing homogeneous manifolds. Integration on manifolds, explanations of Stokes' theorem and de Rham cohomology, and rudiments of differential topology complete this work. It also includes exercises throughout the text to help readers grasp the theory, as well as more advanced problems for challenge-oriented minds at the end of each chapter. Conceived for a one-semester course on Differentiable Manifolds and Lie Groups, which is offered by many graduate programs worldwide, it is a valuable resource for students and lecturers alike. .},

	abstract = {Verantwortlichkeit: Mark Levi, Inhalt: Everybody knows that mathematics is indispensable to physics--imagine where we'd be today if Einstein and Newton didn't have the math to back up their ideas. But how many people realize that physics can be used to produce many astonishing and strikingly elegant solutions in mathematics? Mark Levi shows how in this delightful book, treating readers to a host of entertaining problems and mind-bending puzzlers that will amuse and inspire their inner physicist.Levi turns math and physics upside down, revealing how physics can simplify proofs and lead to quicker solutions and new theorems, and how physical solutions can illustrate why results are true in ways lengthy mathematical calculations never can. Did you know it's possible to derive the Pythagorean theorem by spinning a fish tank filled with water? Or that soap film holds the key to determining the cheapest container for a given volume? Or that the line of best fit for a data set can be found using a mechanical contraption made from a rod and springs? Levi demonstrates how to use physical intuition to solve these and other fascinating math problems. More than half the problems can be tackled by anyone with precalculus and basic geometry, while the more challenging problems require some calculus. This one-of-a-kind book explains physics and math concepts where needed, and includes an informative appendix of physical principles.The Mathematical Mechanic will appeal to anyone interested in the little-known connections between mathematics and physics and how both endeavors relate to the world around us.},
