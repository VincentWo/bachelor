\chapter{ÄŒech Cohomology}
One of the most noticeable invariants of a topological space is the number of its connected components.
While being intuitivele understandable, it is also limited: There are a lot of topological spaces that are
widely different, but have the same number of connected components. This limitation can be in a certain sense
traced back to connectedness being a "low-dimensional" invariant, best seen by trying to prove a seemingly obvious statement
\begin{theorem}
	Let $n \neq m \in \NN$. $\RR^n$ is not homeomorphic to $\RR^m$
\end{theorem}
We can prove this in the case of $n = 1, m > 1$ as follows: Take any $p \in \RR$, then $\RR
\setminus \{p\}$ has two connected components, but $\RR^m \setminus \{q\}$ is connected for any
$q \in \RR^m$, hence the spaces can't be homeomorphic. But for distinguishing the case of $n =
2, m > 2$ this argument fails, because connectedness is a lower dimensional phenomenon.

Various higher dimensional generalizations of connected components have been developed
that overcome this limitation by measuring higher dimensional phenomena. Of these generalizations
cohomology is arguably the easiest to compute and understand. While there are in general multiple different
ways to define cohomology, on "nice" spaces (which includes all smooth manifolds) all of them agree, allowing
us to restrict our attention to just one: ÄŒech cohomology. It tries to reduce the geometric structure of our
usually uncountable spaces back to finite combinatorial objects, whose properties are easier to calculate.

\begin{remark}
One would normally state most of the definitions in this chapter in
the context of modules of a ring $R$, getting vector spaces as a special
case (since vector spaces are exactly the modules of their field),
but since de Rham cohomology only makes sense as a vector space this
would only add needlees abstraction.
\end{remark}

\section{Simplicial cohomology}
% We want to approximate topological spaces with simplicial complexes, a combinatorial
% object:
Before talking about how ÄŒech cohomology approximates topological spaces, we are going
to talk about the combinatorial structures used in the approximation:
\begin{definition}
We call $K = (V, S)$ for sets $V,S$ a \underline{simplicial complex} with
\underline{vertices} $V$ and \underline{simplices} $S$ if the elements of $S$
are non-empty subsets of $V$, calling $\sigma \in S$ a $n$-simplex of $K$ if
it has $n + 1$ elements and if they fullfill the following conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item For every vertex $v \in V$ there is a 0-simplex $\{v\} \in S$
	\item For every $\sigma \in S$ all subsets $\sigma' \subseteq \sigma$
		are also in $S$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
Even though this definition is quite technical, it has an intuitive counterpart: One can
imagine the vertices/0-simplices as points, the 1-simplices as lines between their containing
points, the 2-simplices as filled triangles formed by their points or in general $k$-simplices
as the convex hull of their containing points.

Given a simplicial complex, its cohomology is supposed to measure its holes. One sensible
way to do this is to find closed loops (things without boundary) that can't be "filled"
i.e. aren't the boundary of anything. Formalizing this concept leads to the idea of
a chain complex and its homology:
\begin{definition}
	A \underline{Chain complex} $(C_*, \partial_*)$ is a $\ZZ$-graded
	vector space $C_*$ together with a map
	$\partial_*: C_* \to C_*$ (called \underline{boundary map})
	whose restriction to $C_n$ (which we will denote by $\partial_n$) maps to
	$C_{n - 1}$ and which is nilpotent, i.e. $\partial_*^2 = 0$.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
The \underline{Homology} of a chain complex $(C_*, \partial)$ is the
$\ZZ$-graded vector space:
\[	
	H_n(C_*, \partial_*) = \ker(\partial_n)/\Img(\partial_{n - 1})
\]
\end{definition}
Both of these concepts are already familiar, being dual to cochain complexes and cohomology.
(And later we are going to find a way to dualize these concepts to get a cohomology)

Associating a chain complex to a simplicial complex consists of two steps: Defining the $n$-dimensional objects and a boundary operator.
The $n$-simplices might already seem to be the perfect candidates for it, but they are missing something crucial: An orientation. As in
the differential geometric case, this is easiest imagined in the case of 1-simplices, with e.g. $\{a,b\}$ having two orientations, one
going from $a$ to $b$ and the other going from $b$ to $a$. In the higher dimensional cases orientations also consists of choosing an
ordering of the vertices, though not all different orderings produce truly different orientations e.g. for a 2-simplex $\{a,b,c\}$
both $[a,b,c]$ and $[c,b,a]$ are different orderings representing the same orientation, which generalizes to higher dimensions as
orientation being invariant under even permutations. All of this can be generalized algebraicly by first defining all ordered
simplices:
\begin{definition}
	Given a simplicial complex $K = (V,S)$ we define its ordered $k$-simplices as
	\[
		T_k(K) \coloneqq \{\, (v_0, \dots, v_k) \mid \{v_0, \dots, v_k\} \in S \,\}
	\]
\end{definition}
Then we define the chain complex as a quotient of the vector space generated by this set:
\begin{definition}
	Given a simplicial complex $K = (V,S)$ we define its chain complex as the graded vector space $C_*(K)$:
	\[
		C_k(K) \coloneqq \left. {}^{\displaystyle \bigoplus_{\sigma \in T_k(K)} \RR} \middle/ {}_{ \displaystyle \sim } \right.
	\]
	with $\sim$ being defined such that for any $\tau \in S_{k + 1}$:
	\[
		(v_0, \dots, v_k) \sim (-1)^{|\tau|} (v_{\tau(0)}, \dots, v_{\tau(k)})
	\].
	Given a tuple $(v_0, \dots, v_k)$ we denote its equivalence class as $[v_0, \dots, v_k]$.

	We define the boundary operator $\partial$ of this chain complex as the unique linear map, such that for
	any $k$-simplex $[v_0, \dots, v_k]$:
	\[
		\partial [v_0, \dots, v_k] = \sum_{i = 0}^k [v_0, \dots, \hat{v}_i, \dots, v_k]
	\]
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
	We will omit the proof that this quotient is actually a vector space, that the  	boundary
	operator is well-defined and that it is nil-potent, since this is supposed to be just a 	short
	summary of the prerequisites to define ÄŒech cohomology and all of these proofs are technical
	without providing much insight. For a more detailed account see \cite{wendl_topology_2023},
	especially lecture 29.
\end{remark}
That this definition of boundary operator is actually sensible is best shown by simply applying it:
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics{graphics/simplicial_complex2.pdf}
\caption{A triangle as a simplicial complex}
\label{fig:triangle_simplicial_complex}
\end{figure}
\begin{example}
	Let $K = (V,S)$ with $V = \{a,b,c\}, S = \mathcal{P}(V) \setminus \emptyset$ i.e. a triangle as seen in figure \ref{fig:triangle_simplicial_complex}.
	Then:
	\begin{align*}
		\partial [a,b,c] = [b,c] - [a,c] + [a,b]
			= [a,b] + [b,c] + [c,a]
	\end{align*}
	Which matches the intuitive notion of oriented boundary.
\end{example}
The good thing about simplicial homology is that it is easy to calculate (in particular easy
to do on a computer, since everything is finite) and that is has a nice geometric intuition behind it.
The bad things are that it is only defined for simplicial complexes, which aren't really the objects of
our interests and that we still have to find a way to turn this into a cohomology. % ðŸ˜”

Both of these problems are fixable, though one has to sacrifice some of the geometric intuition.
Turning this into a cohomology can be done purely algebraicly by dualizing the chain complex:
\begin{definition}
The \underline{Cochain Complex} $(C^*, \delta^*)$ of a  chain complex $(C_*, \partial_*)$ is defined as:
\[
	C^n(C_*) \coloneq \{\, f: C_n \to \RR \text{ linear}  \,\}\\
\]
with the boundary operator being defined as
\begin{align*}
	\delta^n: C^n &\to C^{n + 1} \\
	f &\mapsto (f \circ \partial_{n + 1})
\end{align*}
% \label{def:cochain_complex}
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
Note that $C^n(C_*)$ is the so called algebraic dual of $C_n$ since we do not require
boundedness/continouity of the linear maps.
\end{remark}
This is a cochain complex, therefore we can take its cohomology. We are also going to define some convenient shorthands
for the cohomology of a simplicial complex $K$:
\[
	C^*(K) \coloneqq C^*(C_*(K))\quad
	H^*(K) \coloneqq H^*(C_*(K)) \coloneqq H^*(C^*(C_*(K)))
\]

The problem of connecting simplicial complexes to topological spaces is a bit more involved,
especially in the case of general topological spaces. Perhaps the most intuitive (or naÃ¯ve) way
would be to equip simplicial complexes with a topology that matches "the obvious one" in the
simple cases e.g. the topology of the simplicial complex representing a triangle would make it
homeomorphic to a triangle and so on and than define the homology of a space as the homology
of a homeomorphic simplicial complex. This approach does have an appeal, but also problems, the
biggest one being that only very few spaces are homeomorphic to a simplicial complex (not even
all topological manifolds are, though all smooth manifolds). A different approach is offered by
ÄŒech cohomology, which works by approximating spaces as simplicial complexes through the use of
open covers and then taking the limit of all these approximations.

\section{Nerves}
The fundamental tool of ÄŒech cohomologies are nerves:
\begin{definition}
	The \textbf{nerve} $\mathfrak{N}(\mathfrak{U})$ of an open cover
	$\mathfrak{U}$ of a space $X$ is the simplicial complex $K$ with
	vertices $V = \mathfrak{U}$ and simplices:
	\[
		S = \bigcup_{n = 0}^\infty
			\{\,
				\{ U_0, \dots, U_n \}
				\mid
				U_0, \dots, U_n \in \mathfrak{U}:
				U_0 \cap \dots \cap U_n \neq \emptyset
			\,\}
	\]
\end{definition}
That is: We take the open sets as 0-simplices (points), the non-empty intersections as 1-simplices (lines) etc.

The next logical step is then to define:
\begin{definition}
Let $X$ be a topological space with open cover $\mathfrak{U}$. We define \textbf{the ÄŒech cohomology of
$\mathfrak{U}$} as:
\begin{align*}
	\hat{C}^*(\mathfrak{U}) \coloneqq H^*(\mathfrak{N}(\mathfrak{U}))
\end{align*}
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
\label{ex:cech_s1}
Let us look at two open covers of $S^1$, as seen in figure $\ref{figure:circle_nerves}$.
Calling the first cover $\mathfrak{U}$, its nerve consists of the vertices $a,b$ and simplices $\{ a \}, \{ b \}, \{a, b\}$.
Let us start with the chain complex of the nerve. It consists of:
\begin{align*}
	C_0(\mathfrak{N}(\mathfrak{U}))
		= \RR^2,\quad
	C_1(\mathfrak{N}(\mathfrak{U}))
		= \RR
\end{align*}
We denote the canonical generators of $C_0$ as $[a], [b]$ and of $C_1$ as $[a, b]$. (with
the convention $[a, b] = -[b, a]$ from earlier)

Dualizing this results in
\begin{align*}
	C^0(\mathfrak{U}) = \RR^2,\quad
	C^1(\mathfrak{U}) = \RR
\end{align*}
and we can dualize the previous basis to get a canonical basis\footnote{
	Note that this is technically only true in the finite dimensional case, since the dual of
	an infinite sum of vector spaces is the infinite product (with the difference being that the
	elements of the infinite sum are finite linear combinations and the product also contains
	the infinite ones). And since a basis has to generate every element as a finite linear
	combination of itself, the dualization of an infinite basis is not a basis itself.
	But we will mostly ignore this detail by including infinite linear combinations, as long as
	elements from any specific vector space only occur a finite number of times.
}, which we will denote as $\cdual{a}, \cdual{b}$ and $\cdual{a, b}$. (the dual of a basis
vector $a$ is the unique linear map that maps $a$ to 1 and every other basis vector to 0).

The coboundary map $\delta$ then works in the following way:
\begin{align*}
	\delta \cdual{a} = \cdual{b, a},\quad
	\delta \cdual{b} = \cdual{a, b},\quad
	\delta \cdual{a, b} = 0
\end{align*}
\end{example}
Thus we have
\begin{align*}
	\hat{H}^0(\mathfrak{U}) = \langle \cdual{a} + \cdual{b} \rangle = \RR, \quad
	\hat{H}^1(\mathfrak{U}) = 0
\end{align*}
Note that this matches the de Rham cohomology of $[0,1]$ with its canonical smooth structure, but not the de Rham cohomology of $S^1$.


Calling the second cover $\mathfrak{V}$, its nerve consists of the vertices $\alpha, \beta_0,
\beta_1$ together with the simplices $\{\alpha, \beta\}, \{\beta_0, \beta_1\}, \{\beta_1,
\alpha\}$ (and all required subsets). Then the cochain complexes of this are
\begin{align*}
	\hat{C}^0(\mathfrak{V}) = \langle \cdual{\alpha}, \cdual{\beta_0}, \cdual{\beta_1} \rangle,\quad
	\hat{C}^1(\mathfrak{V}) = \langle \cdual{\alpha, \beta_0}, \cdual{\beta_0, \beta_1}, \cdual{\beta_1, \alpha} \rangle,\quad
\end{align*}
with the coboundary operator acting on the 0-simplices as follows:
\begin{align*}
	\delta \cdual{\alpha}  = \cdual{\beta_1, \alpha} - \cdual{\alpha, \beta_0},\quad
	\delta \cdual{\beta_0} = \cdual{\alpha, \beta_0} - \cdual{\beta_0, \beta_1},\quad
	\delta \cdual{\beta_1} = \cdual{\beta_0, \beta_1} - \cdual{\beta_1, \alpha}
\end{align*}
and on the 1-simplices being the zero map, since there are no 2-simplices.
Thus the first cohomology is the quotient of all 2-simplices by the image of
$\delta$ i.e. the differences of them, resulting in
\begin{align*}
	H^0(\mathfrak{V}) &= \langle \cdual{\alpha} + \cdual{\beta_0} + \cdual{\beta_1} \rangle = \RR \\
	H^1(\mathfrak{V}) &= \langle \cdual{\alpha, \beta_0} \rangle = \langle \cdual{\beta_0, \beta_1} \rangle = \langle \cdual{\beta_1, \alpha} \rangle = \RR
\end{align*}
Note that this matches the de Rham cohomology of $S^1$.

This example showcases how a concrete calculation of ÄŒech cohomology works, but also
the dependence of ÄŒech cohomology on the choice of open cover. To fix this dependence
and enable us to define the ÄŒech cohomology of a space itself, we are going to get inspired
by analysis and find a way to take the limit of the cohomologies of all open covers.

\section{ÄŒech Cohomology as a Limit}
Taking the limit of algebraic objects is not possible without some relation between them,
which is why we want to find one that tells us whether a given cover yields a "better" approximation
than another. Let us denote the set of all open covers of a given space $X$ as $\mathcal{O}(X)$.
By interpreting a "finer" cover as better, we can define:
\begin{definition}
An open cover $\mathfrak{U}$ is a \underline{refinement} of another open cover $\mathfrak{V}$
if every open set $U \in \mathfrak{U}$ is contained in some $U \subseteq V \in \mathfrak{V}$.
We denote this as $\mathfrak{V} \prec \mathfrak{U}$.
\end{definition}
This isn't a total order on $\mathcal{O}(X)$, but it fulfills another condition that is almost
as good:
\begin{definition}
A set $I$ with a partial order $\prec$ is called \textbf{directed set} if for every $\alpha,
\beta$ there is a $\gamma$ such that $\alpha \prec \gamma, \beta \prec \gamma$
\end{definition}
It is easy to see that $\prec$ is a partial order on $\mathcal{O}$. This relation also turns
$\mathcal{O}$ into a directed set, because given two covers $\mathfrak{U}, \mathfrak{V}$ of
a space $X$ one can construct a cover by choosing for every point $x \in X$ sets $\U_x \in
\mathfrak{U}, \V_x \in \mathfrak{V}$ with $x \in \U_x, x \in \V_x$. Then $\{\U_x \cap \V_x\}_{x
\in X}$ is an open cover of $X$ and a refinement of both $\mathfrak{U}$ and $\mathfrak{V}$.

This is already a quite usefull structure to have on the covers, but to make it really usefull
we have to turn it into a relation of the ÄŒech cohomologies of the covers. We will do even
better than that by using the refinement relation to induce a cochain map between the ÄŒech
cochain complexes: Given an open cover $\mathfrak{V}$ with index set $J$ and a refinement
$\mathfrak{U}$ with index set $I$, we can choose for every $\alpha \in I$ a $\lambda(\alpha) \in J$
such that $\mathcal{U}_{\alpha} \subseteq \mathcal{V}_{\lambda(\beta)}$. This constructs
a (non-canonical) map $\lambda: I \to J$, which can then be used to create a map:
\begin{align*}
	\lambda^*: C^k(\mathfrak{V}) &\to C^k(\mathfrak{U})\\
	\lambda^*(\sigma)([\alpha_0, \dots, \alpha_k]) &= \sigma([\lambda(\alpha_0), \dots, \lambda(\alpha_k)])
\end{align*}

\begin{remark}
	There is also a more direct way to describe $\lambda^*$ by describing how it acts on the generators
	of $C^k(\mathfrak{U})$. For every $\cdual{\alpha_0, \dots, \alpha_k} \in C^k(\mathcal{V})$ and
	$[\beta_0, \dots, \beta] \in C_k(\mathcal{U})$ it holds:
	\begin{align*}
		\lambda^*(\cdual{\alpha_0, \dots, \alpha_k})([\beta_0, \dots, \beta_k])
			&= \cdual{\alpha_0, \dots, \alpha_k}([\lambda(\beta_0), \dots, \lambda(\beta_k)]) \\
			&= \begin{cases}
				1 \quad&\text{if } \lambda(\beta_i) = \alpha_i \text{ for every } i\\
				0 \quad& \text{otherwise }
			\end{cases}
	\end{align*}
	Therefore
	\begin{align*}
		\lambda^*(\cdual{\alpha_0, \dots, \alpha_k})
			= \sum_{
				\beta_0 \in \lambda^{-1}(\alpha_0),
				\dots,
				\beta_k \in \lambda^{-1}(\alpha_k)
			} \cdual{\beta_0, \dots, \beta_k}
	\end{align*}
\end{remark}
\begin{example}
	Let us continue our previous example \ref{ex:cech_s1}. $\mathfrak{V}$ is a refinement
	of $\mathfrak{U}$ and the corresponding map $\lambda$ looks like:
	\begin{align*}
		\lambda(\alpha) = a,\quad
		\lambda(\beta_0) = \lambda(\beta_1) = b
	\end{align*}
	resulting in a map $\lambda^*$:
	\begin{align*}
		\lambda^*(\cdual{a}) = \cdual{\alpha},\quad
		\lambda^*(\cdual{b}) = \cdual{\beta_0} + \cdual{\beta_1} \\
		\lambda^*(\cdual{a, b}) = \cdual{\alpha, \beta_0} + \cdual{\alpha, \beta_1} \\
	\end{align*}
	Note that $\lambda^*$ maps $\cdual{a} + \cdual{b} = \cdual{\alpha} + \cdual{\beta_0} + \cdual{\beta_1}$
	i.e. maps the generators of the respective 0th cohomology to each other.
\end{example}

% For this concept to be usefull we have to find a relation between the ÄŒech cohomologies of an
% open cover and its refinement. We will do this by defining a map on the chain complexes: Given
% a refinement $\mathfrak{V}$ with index set $J$ of a cover $\mathfrak{U}$ with index set $I$ we
% can define a (non-canonical) map $\lambda: J \to I$ that fullfills the relation:
% \begin{align*}
% 	\V_\alpha \subseteq \U_{\lambda(\alpha)}
% \end{align*}
Turning this into a map of cochain complexes is now easily done by proving that this is a cochain map
i.e. commutes with $\delta$:
\begin{align*}
	(\delta \lambda^*(\sigma))([\alpha_0, \dots, \alpha_k])
		&= \delta \sigma([\lambda(\alpha_0), \dots, \lambda(\alpha_k)]) \\
		&= \sigma(\partial [\lambda(\alpha_0), \dots, \lambda(\alpha_k)]) \\
		&= \sum_{i = 0}^n (-1)^i \sigma([\lambda(\alpha_0), \dots, \hat{\lambda}(\alpha_i), \dots, \lambda(\alpha_k)]) \\
		&= \sum_{i = 0}^n (-1)^i \lambda^*(\sigma)([\alpha_0, \dots, \hat{\alpha}_i, \dots, \alpha_k]) \\
		&= \lambda^* \sigma(\partial [\alpha_0, \dots, \hat{\alpha}_i, \dots, \alpha_k]) \\
		&= (\lambda^* (\delta \sigma))([\alpha_0, \dots, \alpha_k])
\end{align*}


\begin{remark}
The attentive reader might have already noticed it, but the definition of $i$ that we give here
is far frome unique. Depending on the refinement there might be a lot of choice involved in
selecting $\lambda(\alpha)$ for all $\alpha \in I$. Luckily this turns out to not be an actual
problem, since on the level of cohomology all these choices result in the same map. This is
something that we are going to take as granted, since proving it takes rather long and is quite
technical. If interested, see \cite{eilenberg_foundations_1952} for a more detailed account of
ÄŒech cohomology, though one with different notation.
\end{remark}

The collection of the ÄŒech cohomologies of all open covers of space equipped with this maps
is an instance of a quite rich structure:
\begin{definition}
A \textbf{directed system} is a family of vector spaces $\{A\}_{\alpha \in I}$ indexed by a
directed set $\langle I, \prec \rangle$ together with morphisms
\begin{align*}
	f_{\alpha \beta}: A_\alpha \to A_\beta
\end{align*}
for every $\alpha \prec \beta$ that fullfill:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $f_{\alpha \alpha}$ is the identity on $A_\alpha$
	\item For every $\alpha \leqslant \beta \leqslant \gamma$:
		\begin{align*}
			f_{\alpha \gamma} = f_{\beta \gamma} \circ f_{\alpha \beta}
		\end{align*}
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
One can imagine a directed system as a tree-like structure with infinite leaves:

Given such a directed system we would like to define its limit, which we can imagine as a
sort of "root". The most basic requirement being, that there is a map from every member of the
system to it:
\begin{definition}[Target]
	Given a directed system $\{A_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in I}$ of vector spaces we call
	a vector space $T$ together with morphisms $\{\phi_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in I}$:
	\[
		\phi_\alpha: A_\alpha \to T	
	\]
	\underline{Target} of the directed system if for every $\alpha \prec \beta \in I$

	commutes.
\end{definition}
Note that by abuse of notation we will sometimes refer to a target as just a vector space
$B$ while eliding the morphisms if they are clear from context.

While this definition is already usefull, it is also too broad. Every vector space together
with the trivial morphism for every vector space in a system is the target of every direct
system of vector spaces. Wanting to include the information of all possible targets into it,
we define:
\begin{definition}[Direct Limit]
Given a directed system $\{A_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in I}$ of vector spaces we call a target $(L,
\{\phi_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in I})$ a \textbf{direct limit} of the system if for every other

The term "limit" implies some kind of uniqueness and indeed
\begin{lemma}
Given two limits of a direct system there exists a natural isomorphisms between them.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The main trick of this proof is that, given a limit $L$ and target $T$, the existence and uniqueness of
$u: L \to L$ also holds if $L = T$, with the unique map being the identity. Then we can put two different limits $T_1, T_2$ in a diagram:

and by uniqueness $v \circ u = \Id$, hence $T_1$ and $T_2$ are isomorphic.
\end{proof}
Because of this we are going to talk about \textbf{the} limit of a directed system
and denote it by
\[
	\varinjlim \{A_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in I}
\]
Note that this definition leaves the question of actual existence of the limit open,
but there is actually a concrete realization of this limit (though we won't prove it),
in the form of
\[
	{}^{\displaystyle \coprod_{\alpha \in I} A_\alpha} \Bigg/ {}_{\displaystyle \sim}
\]
with $a \sim b$ for $a \in A_\alpha, b \in A_\beta$ if and only if there is a $\gamma \in I$
such that $\alpha \prec \gamma, \beta \prec \gamma$ and $f_{\alpha \gamma}(a) = f_{\beta \gamma}(b)$.

Using this we can finally define the ÄŒech cohomology of a space:
\begin{definition}[ÄŒech Cohomology]
Let $X$ be a topological space. We define its \textbf{ÄŒech cohomology} as the direct limit
of the ÄŒech cohomology of its open cover, denoted by
\[
	\hat{H}^*(X) \coloneqq \varinjlim \{\hat{H}(X, \mathfrak{U})\}_{\mathfrak{U} \in \mathcal{O}(X)}
\]
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
If one looks too close at this definition, one notices that the existence of 
it does not really define the
ÄŒech cohomology of a space as a vector space, but rather as an equivalence class
of naturally isomorphic vector spaces. This is more a philosophical than a practical issue though
since the natural isomorphisms allow us to just take a specific representative as "the" ÄŒech cohomology.
\end{remark}

While this definition is quite elegant, it does suffer from the problem of being impractical.
Given a topological space we would have to calculate the ÄŒech cohomology of all its open covers
and then apply the limiting operation â€“ in most cases this is all but impossible, even with the
specific representation of the limit above.

But there is a solution to this problem. We are going to find a specific collection of covers
whose cohomologies are all isomorphic to each other and, as it will turn out, to the directed
limit. This is because this collection fulfills a certain property:
\begin{definition}
A subset $I_0 \subseteq I$ of a directed set $I$ is called \textbf{cofinal} if for every
$\alpha \in I$ there is a $\beta \in I_0$ such that $\beta \geqslant \alpha$
\end{definition}
Then the important statement is the following lemma:
\begin{lemma}
	Let $\{X_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in I}$ be a directed system with morphisms $f_{\alpha \beta}$.

	If $I_0 \subseteq I$ is a cofinal set such that $\phi_{\alpha, \beta}$ is an isomorphism for every
	$\alpha, \beta \in I_0, \alpha \leqslant \beta$ than $\varinjlim \{A_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in I}$ is isomorphic
	to every $X_\gamma$ for $\gamma \in I_0$.
\end{lemma}


\begin{proof}
Pick $\alpha_0 \in I_0$. For any $\alpha \in I$ there is a $\beta \in I$ such that $\alpha_0 \prec \beta$ and $\alpha \prec \beta$
and since $I_0$ there is a $\gamma \in I_0$ such that $\beta \prec \gamma$. Putting the respective spaces and morphisms in a diagram:
% https://q.uiver.app/#q=WzAsMyxbMiwwLCJBX1xcYWxwaGEiXSxbMSwxLCJBX1xcZ2FtbWEiXSxbMCwwLCJBX3tcXGFscGhhXzB9Il0sWzAsMSwiXFx2YXJwaGlfe1xcYWxwaGEgXFxnYW1tYX0iXSxbMiwxLCJcXHZhcnBoaV97XFxhbHBoYV8wIFxcZ2FtbWF9IiwyXV0=
\[\begin{tikzcd}
	{A_{\alpha_0}} && {A_\alpha} \\
	& {A_\gamma}
	\arrow["{\varphi_{\alpha_0 \gamma}}"', from=1-1, to=2-2]
	\arrow["{\varphi_{\alpha \gamma}}", from=1-3, to=2-2]
\end{tikzcd}\]
The map $\varphi_{\alpha_0 \gamma}$ is an isomorphism, hence we can define:
\begin{align*}
	\psi_\alpha:
		A_\alpha &\to A_{\alpha_0} \\
		x &\mapsto (\varphi_{\alpha_0 \gamma})^{-1} \circ \varphi_{\alpha \gamma} (x)
\end{align*}
This procedure can be repeated for every $\alpha \in I$, making $A_{\alpha_0}$ a target of the system.

Now let $T$ be any other target, with morphisms $\{\tau_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in I}$. Since $A_{\alpha_0}$
is in the system there is a morphism $\tau_{\alpha_0}: A_{\alpha_0} \to B$. This morphism is unique
by construction and hence $A_{\alpha_0}$ is the limit of the direct system.
\end{proof}
Having proven that it suffices to calculate the cohomology of a sufficiently well-behaved type of covers,
it remains to show that such a family exists i.e. that there is a cofinal collection and that all its
cohomologies are isomorphic. A good candidate for this is requiring a certain simplicity of the
sets in the cover and all of their intersections:
\begin{definition}
Given a topological space $X$, a \textbf{great cover} is a cover $\{\U_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in I}$ such that
for any subset $J \subseteq I$ the intersection
\[
	\bigcap_{\alpha \in J} \U_\alpha
\]
is homeomorphic to $\RR^n$
\end{definition}
On general topological spaces great covers are obviously not cofinal in the sets of all covers, since in general
there isn't even a cover of a space with any single set being homeomorphic to $\RR^n$. But since manifolds are
locally euclidean, on them great covers are cofinal!

It of course remains to show that the ÄŒech cohomology of all great covers is isomorphic. While this is a
quite nontrivial fact by itself, for us it will follow as a direct corollary of the de Rham theorem â€“ the
main subject of this thesis.
